TO DO List for System implementations
"-" Means task to complete
"/" Means task is incomplete
"*" Means footnotes about implementation
----------------------------------------
- Create Sprite super class
  * Actually not sure about this, but i think the consolidation will make future changes easier
- Build up a foundation to base everything around the center of a sprite instead of the top left corner
- Change the createPlatforms method to take a csv file as an input and build the level off of the csv file
  * Don't worry about the camera stuff just yet, just have the method save all the data into an arraylist for now
- Redo Collision systems again for the 5th time in a row
- Implement the ability to load an image for sprites
